# Naked Statistics by Charles Wheelan

## Introduction 
"The point of this book is to make the most important statistical concepts more intuitive and more acessible"   

"It's easy to lie with statistics, but it's hard to tell the truth without them" - Andrejs Dunkels  

## Chapter 1: What's the Point?

A handy tool for collapsing complex information into a single number. It has no intrinsic meaning, but a rather a tool for comparison.

Fun fact: The US has a Gini index (a measure of wealth distribution on a scale of 0 to 1, 0 being identical wealth) of 0.45. China is .42. Sweden is .23. Canada is 0.32. Brazil 0.54. South Africa 0.65.

Statistics help us process data, which is really just a fancy name for *information* whether that infromation be trivial or insightful.

1. Descriptive Statistics
- We use descriptive statistics everyday (sports, GPA, etc). Descriptive statistics exist to **simplify**, which always impies some loss of nauce or detail. Anyone working with numbers needs to recognize as much.

2. Inference
- Using data from the "known world" to make informaed inferences and conjecturs about the "unknown world". This is where sampling can come in.
